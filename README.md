The Area Management Application is a Java-based desktop application that allows users to manage a directory of places. Users can perform various operations such as displaying all places, searching for a place by name, adding a new place, deleting a place, contacting a place, and exiting the program.

The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface built using Swing, where users can log in with a username and password. After successful login, they can choose from different options using a dropdown menu and execute the selected operation with the click of a button.

The application reads and writes place information from a text file, allowing the user to store and retrieve data persistently. Places are stored with attributes such as name, address, phone number, and category.

The Area Management Application aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to manage and access information about various places in a particular area.
